WDI-PVD-03 GROUP PROJECT - ASTRODOCS
=====================================

ASTRODOCS
==========

Overview:
----------
Build an app for your client, Xobpord, that allows users to upload files into a virtual file system. Ordinary users can only read/download a file where as Owners can do anything to the files they own. In addition to keeping track of the file structure, this app should associate meta-data with each file, including things like:

    - Date created/uploaded
    - Date modified
    - Owner (user who uploaded the file)
    - Tags

USER STORIES:
--------------
- As a visitor to AstroDocs I need to know how to sign up so that I can become an Owner and sign in(using email, password, and password confirmation)

- As an owner I need to be able to log in with email and password so that only I will have the ability to create, update, and delete files.  

- As an owner I need to be able to change my my password so that I can pick a new one if I would like.  

- As an owner I need to be able to get feedback from the website after after each action's success or failure.

- As an owner I need all forms to clear after submitting (either success or failure) so that I can resubmit forms as needed.  

- As a signed-in Owner I need to know what my options are so that I can work with my files.
Create files
Update files
Must be able to view my files single / many

- As an Owner I need to know where my files are stored so that I can CRUD them.

- As an Owner I need to know how to add tags to my files so that I can find them later.

- The app should keep track of :
date created/uploaded
date modified
owner (user who uploaded the file)
tags

VISITOR STORIES:
----------------
- As a non-authorized visitor to AstroDocs I need to be able to browse recent/ all uploaded files so that I can view them.
- As a non-authorized visitor I need to be able to download files that are available so that I can download them to work on them/view them locally. 
- As a non-authorized visitor to Astro Docs I need to be able to search files by tag or by user so I can find specific files.
